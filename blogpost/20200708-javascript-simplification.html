                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>Today I did something cool, or so I think anyway. </p>
                        <p>In essence what I did was to simplify and reduce the amount of code written to create the nav bar on the side and the header.
                            I have previously treated all of these seperatly with each menuitem in the nav bar (July, My presence and so on) running it's own loop to generate parts of the navbar.</p>
                        <p>In the past I've  used arrays to store the link information and the text information. Example "creating the blog" and "/blogpost/20200701-creating-the-blog.html" has been stored
                            in seperate arrays, (together with the rest of the links under July). I have been meaning to simplify this for some time, but not really been sure how to sort the different varibles. 
                            Well today it came to me. It was almost to simple really. I decided to nest the arrays inside arrays then run a nested loop, the first going through the "container" array (the array that contains all the other arrays)
                            and the nested loop running through the nestedarray. This took me from 7 almost identical loops (only variables differed) to one nested one. This uses 2 indexes a "mainIndex" and an "index" to keep track of the mainloop
                            and nestedloop respectivly. This was not really on the planned todo, but kind of falls under simplifying the code. And wil lbe added today to the updated "website-plans" page. </p>
                            <p>Now what I really need to do is to look at the code for my daughters allowance. And also a logon solution that is a little more robust. Think I can do something very basic in Javascript. But very basic and not really
                            very secure I would assume, more for a dynamic approach to logging on atm and what content to show. Hopefully something I can reuse when I get as far as creating a publishing solution.</p>

                            <p>I also found a mobile http server and it can be visited here (site not being updated and might be down) http://nicolaiimset.serveblog.net:8081/index.html.</p> 
                            <br>
                            <p>Finally this blog/site also got a new link https://nicolaiimset.serveblog.net:8080/index.html but I do need a new server certificate for that on the NAS. 
                            So still using imset.myqnapcloud.com:8080 which is likely what you used to get here.
