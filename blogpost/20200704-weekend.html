                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>Not much time to write or code over the weekend. Have done some training on <a href="https://www.getmimo.com" target="_blank">Mimo</a> which has been one of my main sources of learning.<br>
                        As I stated earlier I got my books now, and also bought some classes from Udemy. I think i got enough places to learn from now with
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mimo</li>
                        <li>FreeCodeCamp</li>
                        <li>Pluralsight</li>
                        <li>Dummies books</li>
                        <li>Udemy</li>
                    </ul>
                    looking forward to the Udemy classes in particular. They are very case driven</p>
                    <p> Site has seen some minor updates in that I now use CSS to fill content into the footer, meaning I finally found one place to have single source of updates
                    this is done through using class::before{content:"string content"}. I really need to dig dseepr into this. I also found a way to display the url as you hover the mouse
                    but would prefer it to pop out rather then just extend the text.</p>
                    <p> That's it for today. Have a great weekend all (If you could read this yet, I have promised myself to let the posts remain when publishing online)</p>
