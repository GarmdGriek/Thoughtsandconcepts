                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>I have decided to make a seperate webpage for the design guidelines and project "roadmap" of this website. It will be added to the bottom
                            where "My story" sits today. I find no value in the My story section of the footer. Also I have decided I need to import the menu from some site.
                            At the momemnt I beleive iframes might be the way to go. This goes for default start page and menu items. This will reduce my (today) 5 webpage update
                            to add or change an item on the blog to 1 page. It will also automatically update the default start page with the blog items as I have stored them on the server.
                            <p>Tasks for today
                                <ul>

                                </ul>
                            I call it a menu. this might be misleading. What I mean is the right side navigation bar, where you can go directly to blog posts. I will keep calling it 
                            menu for the time being though.</p>
                            <p>So far today
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Working on this post</li>
                                    <li>Made the <a href="website-plans.html">website plans</a> page</li>
                                    <li>Worked on menu</li>
                                    <li>Worked on design ideas</li>
                                    <li>Reduced size of header</li>
                                    <li>Mostly reduced the footer</li>
                                    <li>made navbar to the left. Again need to find a way to inject it.</li>
                                    <li>stopped calling navbar menu and calling it navbar-left and navbar-right now
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Code does not reflect this... yet...</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    <li>Created frontend login page. it will get basic funtionality soon</li>
                                    <li>Will hopefully tonight have javascript to permit "logon" with custom content for my daughter</li>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>
                            So iframes might be a dead end, unless I redesign the entire site, I can't find a way to make links in iframes open on the main page.It's either in the iframe or 
                            _blank which gives a new window. Meaning I am now looking for a javascript solution. Up untill now there is no script elements on this site. That will change soon 
                            as I skill up on javascript. </p>
                            <p>I know need to find a way to publish this as the main points on the design are done. there are still alot left. buyt i got the header/footer like i'd like. 
                            and both left and right navbars funtions. They will in the future have some on click or mouseover to appear instead of just sitting there. Right now I am happy with them
                            I also need to incorporate parts of the old site to this site. Especially the page on weekly allowances.</p>
                            <p> I believe version 0.2020.6 might soon be ready to go online, I do like the design on a large screen. However on lower resolutions it does not work so well.
                            Thinking some Javascript will solve that. Uncertain if I need to create the inject solution first for html on the pages. I keep updating too many places..
