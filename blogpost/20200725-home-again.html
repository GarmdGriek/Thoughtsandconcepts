                        <p><p>A week has passed since my last post. This week I have spent mostly offline in a cabin lying in #fjordcountry #Norway more specifically a cabin in ØydvinStød.
                            Absolutly a nice place *1 and absolutly a place I won't be going back to again *2. The reasons for this are that due to the advertisement for the place and the conversation
                            we had with the owner, some expectations were set. As these seemed to be not true or atleast greatly exaggerated our total experience was not as good as it would have been
                            if everything had been clearly communicated. <br>
                            example : instead of saying they were looking at having EV charging there for this summer, they could have just said there was no EV charging there. I honestly do not really 
                            care much if they install it tomorrow, next week, in august or in 10 years time as I am home now and have no plans of going back.<br>
                            there were several of these "misunderstandings" as in Sauna, EV charging, Boat type, boat size, engine size and so on <br>
                            also some of the fault was our own, we should not have visited a fjord described as a cold fjord where we can see whales. (Ofcourse there were no whales, but we did not expect it to be). 
                            However 12c-14c water is too cold for anything fun/sensible. neighbouring fjords had swimming temperatures in the water, but Osafjorden gets alot of meltwater from the mountains. Learning experience.
                            Also if we were into fishing we would have enjoyed it much more, as the boats are clearly prepared for fishing, not for adventuring and the fjord is rich in fish.<br>
                            <br>
                            Despite the shortcomings we enjoyed our week and decided to not go back there again. Some amazing nature there though..<br>
