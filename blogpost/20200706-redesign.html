                        <p>Still working within the guidelines I have learned three things
                            <ol>
                                <li>Colors are hard and a very personal matter.</li>
                                <li>Mobile version is vital as noone seems to use computers anymore</li>
                                <li>Single points of update are both more important and harder then I imagined</li>
                            </ol> 
                            However I am now at the point where I got less places to update (once again), my Javascript is reduced and simplified. my CSS is prettier and most of the site
                            works as I would like it to work. So yesterday I had a right hand menu and a left hand menu. today I merged those on the left. I also figured out why my CSs padding was off 
                            and could finally remove the 25px white gap on top of the page. What is left is to reduce number of FOR loops in my script. I also translated a script (hidden) from 
                            Norwegian to english. Wish I ujnderstood what on earth made me make Norwegian variables, classes and Id's in the first place. find/replace is a great help to sort it out
                            Still some items need translating, but it can wait. Not critical for now though</p>
                            <p>Oh.. also and importantly, site published today and I made a link to it from our company social sharing plattform. with the articel on Dell and Cloudera, really courius as 
                            to if the webserver can handle it or not. It is really slow, especially when diskchecks kick in. I run scheduled regular diskchecks every week on it.</p>
                            <p> For later tonight I will make menu "invisible/hidden" untill mouse is moved over it. I also need to think about how to make webpages autopopulate into the menu. 
                            This kind of sounds like php to me or node.js/edon.js maybe. We will see. The webpage for blogposts needs to be rename and sorted as well to something more sortable. </p>
