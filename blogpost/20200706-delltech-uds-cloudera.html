                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>Over the last year or so Cloudera and Dell Technologies UDS (Unstructured Data Storage division) have been validating solutions and products together.
                        This has resulted in some reccomendations and certifications on CDH and HDP and hopefully soon CDP. This is fantastic news for customers and partners alike</p>
                        <p>Let me explain. About 18 months ago Cloudera and Hortonworks merged as companies, this means customers now have one less option on the market.
                        There used to be 3 big players as in Cloudera, Hortonworks and Apache. The two former are commercial companies while Apache is opensource software.</p>
                        <p> Now I wrote that Cloudera and Hortonworks had merged and that this was good for the customers. And I mean to explain why here. It's simple really, 
                        instead of now having to get knowledge aobut 2 or 3 (potentially) more hadoop ecosystems there is now one single source which takes the best from the 2 largest. 
                        I have no idea if that will be for the best in 5 years or if hadoop will be the prefered way of analyising big data then, but for now it's good. Good for cloudera, good for Hortonworks,
                        good for Dell and good for the customer.(OneFS also support other distributions like Ambari, Pivotal and others. But the 3 mentioned are the most common with Cloudera and Hortonworks being the absolute most seen 
                        at our customers.)</p>
                        <p>So why OneFS. Well there are several reasons, but mainly because we decouple the storage from the compute, giving agility to the installation</p>
                        
                        <img class="delltech" src="/images/Delltech/hdfs-traditional.jpg">
                        <p>This is a proven solution that works but lacks agility, however with PowerScale you can do this</p>
                        <img class="delltech" src="/images/Delltech/hdfs-isilon-namenode.jpg">
                        <p>and then you can have clients read the results directly from the PowerScale installation, using nfs or smb protocols.<br>
                        How an PowerScale OneFS Hadoop implementation differs from a traditional Hadoop deployment</p>
                        <p></p><strong>A Hadoop implementation with OneFS differs from a typical Hadoop implementation in the following ways:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Hadoop compute and HDFS storage layers are on separate clusters instead of the same cluster.</li>
                            <li> Instead of storing data within a Hadoop distributed file system, the storage layer functionality is fulfilled by OneFS on an PowerScale
                            cluster. Nodes on the PowerScale cluster function as both a NameNode and a DataNode.</li>
                            <li>The compute layer is established on a Hadoop compute cluster that is separate from the PowerScale cluster. The Hadoop MapReduce
                            framework and its components are installed on the Hadoop compute cluster only.
                            <li>Instead of a storage layer, HDFS is implemented on OneFS as a native, lightweight protocol layer between the PowerScale cluster and
                            the Hadoop compute cluster. Clients from the Hadoop compute cluster connect over HDFS to access data on the PowerScale cluster.</li>
                            <li>In addition to HDFS, clients from the Hadoop compute cluster can connect to the PowerScale cluster over any protocol that OneFS
                            supports such as NFS, SMB, FTP, and HTTP. PowerScale OneFS is the only non-standard implementation of HDFS offered that
                            allows for multi-protocol access. PowerScale makes for an ideal alternative storage system to native HDFS by marrying HDFS services
                            with enterprise-grade data management features.</li>
                            <li>Hadoop compute clients can connect to any node on the PowerScale cluster that functions as a NameNode instead of being routed by
                            a single NameNode.</li>
                        </ul></p>
