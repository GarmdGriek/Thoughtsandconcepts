                            <p>Time flies by, the last month I have been bust with 3 things basically. (besides work that is)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Tesla
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Eu inspection</li>
                                        <li>Replacing brakes after eu inspection</li>
                                        <li>Replacing something in front suspension after eu inspection</li>
                                        <li>Finding garages with time and skills to perform above items</li>
                                        <li>today I learned that Tesla was done with their bit, so car is complete.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Fortunatly it still had not emissions.
                                </li>
                                <li>Daughters, kindergarten and school and getting them to understand it's not vacation anymore</li>
                                <li>Sourdough. I learned sourdough is too sticky for Teflon (Today)</li>
                            </ul></p>
                            <p>
                                I have also been thinking about this site and what to do next. I beleive some of it needs to transition serverside.<br>
                                Also I need some sort of database. Currently thinking mySQL and PHP, but neighbour which actually programs seems to think PHP is a dying language<br>
                                Bit at a loss right now. The hosting plattform (QNAP NAS) does offer native PHP support and MySQL which does mean I lean towards that solution.
