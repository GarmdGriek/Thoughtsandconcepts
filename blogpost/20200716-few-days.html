                        <p>That doesn't mean nothing has changed on this site however. Mostly the changes on the backend though. In summary both the JavaScript and CSS is now better code, easier to read and less lines.
                            Also the navbar on the right is now more automated. It used to be written in html, now it's mostly injected by JavaScript, and the html side of things will be further reduced untill I only have the 
                            <div> tag left. Everything else is better injected as it gives flexibility to change the menu witohut having to cvhange all the pages to do so. The footer is still created in CSS only and 
                            the header is mostly injected through JavaScript. On the website plans page I have updated with completed, cancelled and things I am working on. Right now I am again reworking the JavaScript and CSS for the navbar. 
                            In summary I want it to work differently on small screens with lower resolution then on larger screens, I also want it to behave a certain way when you change form large to small screen, while keeping a good user 
                            interface and all content available for all. Good thing I am on vacation and got time to code :) I the future ff you are on a large screen/computer monitor witha browser windows wider then 1540 pixels you will see 
                            the entire menu, if on a smaller resolution it will be a button to call the menu into being, or rather take you to a page with all the menu items listed. This is currently in testing and if you read this
                            from a mobile device. I am sorry.</p>
                            <p>Further I got classes at Freecodecamp.org to go through (responsive webdesign certification) and udemy (create a Youtube like site). Also knowing the limitations in performance of my soon 10 year old NAS I will need
                            to find a place to host all the goodness that is to come, then maybe have the NAS feed it content for the upcoming "youtube like site", not really planned that far yet. I do enjoy playing with JavaScript and HTMl, 
                            bending it to my will (most of the time) and learning possibilities and limitations.</p>
                            <p>Btw for those wondering why a password has to be secure. I made a basic 8 character password and hashed it with aes256 bit. On <a href="https://crackstation.net/">https://crackstation.net/</a> it was cracked as soon as I pressed the button. Longer passwords were 
                            not cracked by this site.</p>
                            <p>Best regards!</p>
