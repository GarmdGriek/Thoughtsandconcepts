                        <p>The design guidelines mentioned yesterday, showed 4 point I would like to work on. They are listed in the list below</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Decent design - Guidelines</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Simplistic</li>
                                    <li>Clean</li>
                                    <li>Fast</li>
                                    <li>Appealing</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul> 
                        <p>As I write this I have just started the menu on the right side of the monitor, you will see it as "July" with 2 items underneath it. 
                        I spent precious time getting the CSS for this one right. Also considering adding a hide button to it. Which will make it dissapear 
                        for the time being. Not quite certain how I would make it reappear though, well I know the concept og onclick and changing styles through Javascript.
                        Will sort it out soon</p>
                        <p>There are some minor changes from yesterday as to how I write as well. Yesterday i wrote in Index.html (the default page for this site so to speak).
                        today I am writing in a page dedicated to this blogpost. atm it's called day2.html, it will change though. and this content will be copied into the 
                        index.html site over the current content, while the current content will be reduced to a title, picture and ingress. Untill the publishing solution 
                        is ready (not even started that class yet) I have to do this manually.
                        </p> 
                        <p>This file was just renamed into <a href="make-the-navigation-easy.html">make-the-navigation-easy</a> which is a clickable link as well. Also done manually 
                        and something i hope to automate in the future.</p>
