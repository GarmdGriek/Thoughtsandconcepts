                            <p><p>It's that time of the year again.</p>
                                Vacation is over and as usual July is not the best of months in Norway, lot's of rain and coolish weather, hardly ever above 20. We did have a nice vacation though, or staycation as some call it.
                            We spent roughly 3 of the 4 weeks put at home. fortunatly Larvik and the penninsual outside larvik is suningly gorgeous, with tons of places to go for a swim or a walk. So for roughly 3 weeks we did that.</p>
                            <p> but that leaves a week and some? Yes it does. One day I took my two daughters, who are also vegan, for icecream. Now this does not sound special in itself, but this place in Sarpsborg called Palma cafe has the most amazing vegan icecream
                                The kind you taste and are amazed, everytime. Also it's located in a park/beach area which is fantastic. Unfortunatly it's 3 hours and a ferry away (each way). So we spent a day to get icecream. We also got hotdogs, fries, loadedfries and other things when we were there, but the goal was always the icecream<br>
                                Monday two weeks ago, we went to a zoo. and not just any zoo, we went to Kristiansand dyrehage, home of Kardemommeby, Hakkebakkeskogen, Kaptein Sabeltann and some animals. It was a great day, although it ended up being quite expensive. Total for 1 adult (appearantly me) and 2 kids) is 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>entrance 1500 NOK</li>
                                    <li>Food roughly 1500 NOK</li>
                                    <li>toys/hats roughly 300 NOK</li>
                                    <li>food enroute 400 NOK</li>
                            </ul>
                            So for a single day we hit nearly 4000 NOK. Money well spent, will do it again.</p>
                            <p>A week left. that was spent in Fjordcountry. There are pictures in my previous post. But I surprised myself as to how far inland it really was. The fjords are truly massive. Google maps <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ovmg8Dje4r7FdZ8B7">(link to google maps)</a></p>
                            <p>Now it's back to work and trying to find out how the world has turned the last 4 weeks</p>
