                            Hi there. I work for Dell Technologies in the Unstructured data division. I am also learning some coding these days
                            primarily i work with HTML,CSS and Javascript I have looked briefly at Python, but have no use for it atm, 
                            maybe later when i want to do some machinelearning type programming. My career in it started back in 1996 for
                            a small consultancy company, where I worked 1.-3. line support as well as doing sales and some accounting. 
                            In 2001 I left the company for a major (at the time) service provider. Where i worked untill 2008 with a 5 month break
                            where i worked on establishing a service provider and built a datacenter for a collection agency software developer. 
                            In 2008 I began working with sales as an inside presales for Dell and have since worked as a system engineer and a system
                            engineering manager. In 2013 I moved to unstructured data division where I currently work as a manager.</p>
